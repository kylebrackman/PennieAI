Repeat CSF Analysis & Inflammatory Marker Report
Examination Date: October 5, 2013
Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Veterinarian: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM – Neurology Unit
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Diagnostic Laboratory

Indications:
A repeat CSF analysis was conducted to monitor the progression of the inflammatory markers following the initial findings in Document 26.

Test Results:

Protein Levels:
Slightly elevated compared to the previous analysis.
Cell Count (Pleocytosis):
Persistently mild increase, with a similar cellular profile as before.
Inflammatory Markers:
New analysis of select inflammatory markers reveals modest elevations in interleukin levels and other cytokines, suggestive of a low-grade, ongoing inflammatory process.
Microbiology:
No infectious agents were detected.
Interpretation & Recommendations:

The repeat CSF analysis confirms a persistent, mild inflammatory process in the central nervous system.
These findings, in conjunction with the gradual worsening on neuroimaging and clinical examination, support the need for continued monitoring and possible adjustment of the anti-inflammatory regimen.
A re-evaluation of the treatment plan will be considered at the next follow-up, with additional testing as needed to clarify the underlying cause of these inflammatory changes.
