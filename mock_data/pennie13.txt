Surgical Excision of Skin Mass Report
Procedure Date: May 10, 2012
Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Surgeon: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Surgical Unit

Background:
During a routine examination, a small, raised skin mass (approximately 1.5 cm in diameter) was noted on Pennie’s left flank. Given its gradual growth over several months, surgical excision was recommended for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Procedure Details:

Anesthesia: General anesthesia administered following pre-operative blood work (results within normal limits).
Surgical Technique:
The area around the mass was aseptically prepped and locally infiltrated with a regional anesthetic.
A clean excision was performed with a margin of surrounding tissue.
Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.
The excised tissue was submitted for histopathological analysis.
Intraoperative Findings:
The mass was well-circumscribed, with no invasion into deeper tissues.
No additional lesions were observed during the procedure.
Outcome:

The surgery was uneventful, and Pennie recovered smoothly from anesthesia.
The owner was informed of the procedure details and advised on post-operative care.
