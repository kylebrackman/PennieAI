Neurology Specialist Follow-Up & Empirical Treatment Trial Report
Consultation Date: August 12, 2013
Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Specialist: Dr. Linda Morales, DVM – Neurology Specialist
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Neurology Unit

Summary of Consultation:
Following the advanced neuroimaging study, Pennie was re-evaluated to further assess her subtle but concerning neurological signs.

Clinical Findings:

Neurological Exam:
Persistent mild ataxia and intermittent episodes of disorientation noted.
Slight delays in response during proprioceptive testing on the left side.
Discussion:
Dr. Morales reviewed the MRI findings with Dr. Ramirez and explained that while the results are not definitive, the combination of clinical signs and imaging raises suspicion for an underlying inflammatory or degenerative process affecting the central nervous system.
Empirical Treatment Trial:

Intervention:
Initiated a low-dose anti-inflammatory treatment regimen aimed at modulating the suspected immune-mediated process.
Adjunctive antioxidant therapy was also started, based on the hypothesis of neurodegenerative involvement.
Owner Instructions:
Jennifer was advised to monitor Pennie closely for any changes in behavior, coordination, or seizure frequency.
A detailed log of any neurological episodes and behavioral changes is to be maintained.
Plan:
A follow-up neurological re-evaluation is scheduled for 3 months to assess clinical response and review any changes in imaging or laboratory markers.
Further adjustments to the treatment protocol will be based on the patient’s progress.
