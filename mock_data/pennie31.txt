Examination Date: November 15, 2013
Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Specialist: Dr. Linda Morales, DVM – Neurology Unit
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Neurology Unit

Clinical Summary:
Pennie was re-evaluated due to a subtle increase in ataxia and more frequent brief episodes of disorientation, despite the ongoing low-dose anti-inflammatory treatment and antioxidant therapy initiated in Document 28.

Examination Findings:

Gait & Coordination:
Persistent mild ataxia remains with slightly increased stumbling, particularly on uneven terrain.
Neurological Function:
Intermittent episodes of disorientation continue, with brief delays in proprioceptive responses on the left side.
Repeat Imaging & Laboratory Correlation:
Comparison with previous MRI findings shows a very slight increase in the hyperintensity areas.
A recent repeat of CSF inflammatory markers indicates stable yet persistently elevated levels.
Intervention & Adjustments:

Medication Adjustment:
Increased the dosage of the anti-inflammatory agent slightly and added a low-dose immunomodulatory medication as an adjunct.
Recommendations:
Continue close monitoring with a follow-up neurological exam in 3 months.
Maintain a detailed log of any changes in neurological signs or behavior.
Owner Counseling:
Jennifer was advised about the need for careful observation and to report any further changes promptly.
