Dear Jennifer,

Following our cardiology consultation on June 8th, I wanted to provide you with a brief summary of the findings regarding Pennie’s heart evaluation.

The examination, including ECG and echocardiography, indicates that the systolic murmur is likely incidental and does not currently signify a major health concern. I recommend that we continue to monitor her heart with annual evaluations. In the meantime, please maintain her current moderate exercise routine and keep a close watch for any signs of difficulty during activity, such as excessive fatigue or labored breathing.

Should you notice any changes or have further questions, feel free to contact me or our clinic.

Thank you for your continued commitment to Pennie’s health.

Best regards, Dr. Robert Chen, DVM
