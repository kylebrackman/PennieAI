Dear Dr. Morales,

Thank you for the recent consultation on November 15th. I wanted to provide some feedback and ask a few questions regarding Pennie’s condition. Since the adjustment in her medication, I have noticed that her coordination seems a bit more off during our evening walks, although she still remains active otherwise. I’m also concerned about her occasional moments of disorientation, which seem to be occurring more frequently than before.

Could you please advise if these changes are expected as we adjust her treatment, or if there might be any other steps we should consider at this stage? Also, do you recommend any specific strategies at home to help her cope during these episodes?

I appreciate your guidance and look forward to your suggestions.

Best regards, Jennifer Thompson
