Orthopedic Radiographic Examination Report – Hip Evaluation
Examination Date: January 15, 2013
Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Veterinarian: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM
Facility: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Radiology Department

Indication:
Due to breed predisposition and a mild report of occasional hind limb stiffness during the December wellness exam, radiographs of the hips and surrounding joints were recommended to screen for early signs of hip dysplasia.

Procedure:

Standard ventrodorsal and lateral radiographic views of both hips were obtained.
Pennie was positioned under light sedation to ensure optimal imaging quality.
Findings:

Hip Joint Conformation:
Mild incongruity observed in the left hip joint.
Slight flattening of the acetabulum with a minor degree of subluxation noted.
Osteoarthritic Changes:
No significant osteophyte formation; joint spaces appeared maintained.
Overall Assessment:
Findings are suggestive of early degenerative changes consistent with a mild form of hip dysplasia.
Impression & Recommendations:

Recommend conservative management with lifestyle modifications, including moderate exercise and weight management.
Consider periodic re-evaluation with radiographs in 12–18 months to monitor progression.
Initiate a joint-support supplement regimen and consider physical therapy if stiffness worsens.
