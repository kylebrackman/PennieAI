Owner Email Inquiry – Vaccination & Preventive Care
Email Date: April 2, 2011
From: Jennifer Thompson (jennifer.thompson@example.com)
To: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM (susan.ramirez@brooksidevet.com)
Subject: Inquiry About Vaccination Schedule & Preventive Care

Email Content:

Dear Dr. Ramirez,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to check in regarding Pennie’s vaccination schedule. Since her initial exam and lab work in early March, I was wondering if there are any vaccinations or additional preventive measures you recommend at this stage.

Additionally, please advise if there are any concerns based on her lab work that I should monitor.

Thank you for your guidance and for taking great care of Pennie.

Best regards,
Jennifer Thompson

Response (Attached as Reply):

Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for your email. Based on Pennie’s current status and lab results, she is due for her core vaccinations. I recommend scheduling her for a rabies vaccination and a booster for her distemper, parvovirus, and adenovirus immunizations.

Also, I suggest starting her on a routine heartworm preventive treatment and a monthly flea/tick preventative if not already in place. There is nothing concerning in her lab work at this time; the mild increase in white blood cells is most likely due to the stress of the visit.

Please contact our office to arrange an appointment for these preventive treatments.

Best regards,
Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM

Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Veterinarian: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM – Neurology Consultation
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Neurology Unit

Presenting Concerns:

Owner reports that Pennie has experienced intermittent episodes of unsteadiness and slight head tilting, particularly noted during walks and after periods of rest.
Occasional brief episodes resembling mild seizures were observed, though these were short-lived and self-resolving.
Examination Findings:

Gait & Coordination:
Mild ataxia observed during ambulation, with slight imbalance on turns.
Occasional stumbling noted, more pronounced during rapid direction changes.
Cranial Nerve Evaluation:
Slight deficit in proprioceptive positioning of the left forelimb; no overt facial asymmetry.
Pupillary light reflexes normal.
Reflexes:
Slight hyperreflexia noted in the hind limbs.
Behavioral Observations:
Pennie appears slightly disoriented at times but remains responsive and alert overall.
Assessment & Plan:

Findings are subtle yet concerning for a possible evolving neurological process.
Recommend further diagnostic tests to evaluate for an inflammatory or degenerative process.
Schedule advanced imaging and electrophysiological studies in the near future.
Advise owner to monitor for any progression of signs such as increased incoordination, prolonged seizures, or changes in behavior.

EEG and CSF Analysis Report
Examination Date: July 22, 2013
Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Veterinarian: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM – Neurology Unit
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Diagnostic Imaging & Laboratory

Indications:
Following the neurological exam, Pennie underwent an electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis to investigate the reported intermittent neurological signs.

Diagnostic Testing:

EEG Findings:
Recorded baseline brain activity is mostly within normal limits; however, intermittent, subtle spike-wave discharges were noted during periods of drowsiness.
No sustained seizure activity was captured during the study.
CSF Analysis:
Slightly elevated protein levels noted.
Mild pleocytosis (increased cell count) observed, suggesting a low-grade inflammatory process.
No infectious agents identified on preliminary screening.
Interpretation & Recommendations:

The combined findings of subtle EEG abnormalities and mild inflammatory changes in the CSF are nonspecific but raise concern for an emerging neurological condition with an inflammatory component.
These results will be correlated with ongoing clinical signs and further diagnostic imaging.
Recommend a follow-up neurological evaluation and repeat CSF analysis in 6–8 weeks to monitor progression.
Continue supportive care and advise owner to report any further episodes of disorientation or seizure-like activity.

Attending Veterinarian: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM – Neurology Unit
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Neurology Unit

Clinical Summary:
Pennie was re-evaluated to assess changes in her neurological status after initiating the empirical anti-inflammatory treatment. The owner reported occasional worsening of ataxia and sporadic episodes of disorientation over the past two months.

Examination Findings:

Gait & Coordination:
Persistent, mild ataxia remains, with slightly increased stumbling noted on uneven surfaces.
Neurological Function:
A slight delay in proprioceptive responses persists, particularly on the left side.
No overt seizures were observed during the exam, but brief periods of disorientation were noted.
Repeat Imaging Comparison:
A comparison with the previous MRI (Document 27) indicates that the subtle hyperintensities in the white matter appear slightly more pronounced, though still nonspecific.
Assessment & Plan:

The re-evaluation suggests a gradual progression of the neurological abnormalities despite treatment.
Recommendations include a repeat of key laboratory markers (see Document 30), continued empirical treatment, and close monitoring for any further deterioration.
A follow-up appointment is scheduled in three months to reassess clinical status and adjust therapy as necessary.

Repeat CSF Analysis & Inflammatory Marker Report
Examination Date: October 5, 2013
Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Veterinarian: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM – Neurology Unit
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Diagnostic Laboratory

Indications:
A repeat CSF analysis was conducted to monitor the progression of the inflammatory markers following the initial findings in Document 26.

Test Results:

Protein Levels:
Slightly elevated compared to the previous analysis.
Cell Count (Pleocytosis):
Persistently mild increase, with a similar cellular profile as before.
Inflammatory Markers:
New analysis of select inflammatory markers reveals modest elevations in interleukin levels and other cytokines, suggestive of a low-grade, ongoing inflammatory process.
Microbiology:
No infectious agents were detected.
Interpretation & Recommendations:

The repeat CSF analysis confirms a persistent, mild inflammatory process in the central nervous system.
These findings, in conjunction with the gradual worsening on neuroimaging and clinical examination, support the need for continued monitoring and possible adjustment of the anti-inflammatory regimen.
A re-evaluation of the treatment plan will be considered at the next follow-up, with additional testing as needed to clarify the underlying cause of these inflammatory changes.

Neurology Specialist Follow-Up & Medication Adjustment Report
Examination Date: November 15, 2013
Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Specialist: Dr. Linda Morales, DVM – Neurology Unit
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Neurology Unit

Clinical Summary:
Pennie was re-evaluated due to a subtle increase in ataxia and more frequent brief episodes of disorientation, despite the ongoing low-dose anti-inflammatory treatment and antioxidant therapy initiated in Document 28.

Examination Findings:

Gait & Coordination:
Persistent mild ataxia remains with slightly increased stumbling, particularly on uneven terrain.
Neurological Function:
Intermittent episodes of disorientation continue, with brief delays in proprioceptive responses on the left side.
Repeat Imaging & Laboratory Correlation:
Comparison with previous MRI findings shows a very slight increase in the hyperintensity areas.
A recent repeat of CSF inflammatory markers indicates stable yet persistently elevated levels.
Intervention & Adjustments:

Medication Adjustment:
Increased the dosage of the anti-inflammatory agent slightly and added a low-dose immunomodulatory medication as an adjunct.
Recommendations:
Continue close monitoring with a follow-up neurological exam in 3 months.
Maintain a detailed log of any changes in neurological signs or behavior.
Owner Counseling:
Jennifer was advised about the need for careful observation and to report any further changes promptly.

Subject: Follow-Up on Pennie’s Neurological Condition and Treatment Adjustments

Email Content:

Dear Dr. Morales,

Thank you for the recent consultation on November 15th. I wanted to provide some feedback and ask a few questions regarding Pennie’s condition. Since the adjustment in her medication, I have noticed that her coordination seems a bit more off during our evening walks, although she still remains active otherwise. I’m also concerned about her occasional moments of disorientation, which seem to be occurring more frequently than before.

Could you please advise if these changes are expected as we adjust her treatment, or if there might be any other steps we should consider at this stage? Also, do you recommend any specific strategies at home to help her cope during these episodes?

I appreciate your guidance and look forward to your suggestions.

Best regards, Jennifer Thompson
