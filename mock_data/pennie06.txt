Dear Jennifer,

I’m writing to provide you with a summary of Pennie’s visit on April 15th, during which she received her scheduled vaccinations. I am pleased to report that she handled the procedures very well with no significant adverse reactions.

As a reminder, please keep an eye on the injection sites over the next 48 hours. Although we noted only minimal swelling at one site, please let us know if you observe any changes such as increased swelling, redness, or if Pennie appears lethargic or in discomfort.

In addition, maintain her regular routine, but consider a slightly reduced level of strenuous activity for the next day as a precaution.

Should you have any questions or if you notice any concerning symptoms, please do not hesitate to call the clinic.

Thank you for your continued trust in our care for Pennie.

Warm regards,
Dr. Susan Ramirez
Brookside Veterinary Clinic
