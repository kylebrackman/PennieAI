EEG and CSF Analysis Report
Examination Date: July 22, 2013
Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Veterinarian: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM – Neurology Unit
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Diagnostic Imaging & Laboratory

Indications:
Following the neurological exam, Pennie underwent an electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis to investigate the reported intermittent neurological signs.

Diagnostic Testing:

EEG Findings:
Recorded baseline brain activity is mostly within normal limits; however, intermittent, subtle spike-wave discharges were noted during periods of drowsiness.
No sustained seizure activity was captured during the study.
CSF Analysis:
Slightly elevated protein levels noted.
Mild pleocytosis (increased cell count) observed, suggesting a low-grade inflammatory process.
No infectious agents identified on preliminary screening.
Interpretation & Recommendations:

The combined findings of subtle EEG abnormalities and mild inflammatory changes in the CSF are nonspecific but raise concern for an emerging neurological condition with an inflammatory component.
These results will be correlated with ongoing clinical signs and further diagnostic imaging.
Recommend a follow-up neurological evaluation and repeat CSF analysis in 6–8 weeks to monitor progression.
Continue supportive care and advise owner to report any further episodes of disorientation or seizure-like activity.
