Advanced Neuroimaging Report
Examination Date: August 5, 2013
Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Veterinarian: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM – Neurology & Radiology Unit
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Advanced Imaging Center

Indications:
Due to ongoing intermittent ataxia, subtle seizure-like episodes, and behavioral changes, advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical spine was performed to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or inflammatory changes.

Imaging Findings:

Brain:
Mild, diffuse hyperintensity in several white matter regions on T2-weighted images; findings are nonspecific but could be consistent with an inflammatory process.
No overt masses, hemorrhage, or infarcts identified.
Cervical Spine:
No significant compressive lesions or disc herniations noted.
Overall Impression:
The imaging findings are subtle. They do not point to a definitive diagnosis but raise concern for an early inflammatory or degenerative process affecting the central nervous system.
Recommendations:

Recommend correlating these findings with ongoing clinical evaluations and further laboratory testing (including inflammatory markers).
Advise a repeat MRI in 6–8 months to monitor for progression.
Continue to monitor neurological signs and adjust management as needed.
