Owner Phone Consultation – Discussion of Radiographic Findings and Exercise Recommendations
Consultation Date: January 17, 2013
From: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM
To: Jennifer Thompson
Mode: Telephone Call Follow-Up

Summary of Discussion:

Radiographic Findings:
Dr. Ramirez explained that Pennie’s radiographs showed mild hip incongruity with early degenerative changes suggestive of a mild hip dysplasia.
Management Plan:
Emphasis was placed on maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding excessive high-impact activities.
Jennifer was advised to incorporate moderate, low-impact exercises (such as controlled walks and swimming) into Pennie’s routine.
A joint-support supplement was recommended to help maintain joint health, and a follow-up orthopedic evaluation was suggested in about 12–18 months.
Owner Concerns Addressed:
Jennifer expressed concern about Pennie’s occasional stiffness. Dr. Ramirez reassured her that the current findings are manageable with conservative care.
Specific instructions were provided regarding monitoring for any increase in lameness or discomfort.
Next Steps:
Jennifer was advised to call if Pennie’s symptoms worsen or if any new issues arise.
A follow-up appointment was scheduled for a recheck in six months to assess clinical status and discuss potential adjustments to the exercise plan.
