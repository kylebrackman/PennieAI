Subject: Inquiry About Vaccination Schedule & Preventive Care

Email Content:

Dear Dr. Ramirez,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to check in regarding Pennie’s vaccination schedule. Since her initial exam and lab work in early March, I was wondering if there are any vaccinations or additional preventive measures you recommend at this stage.

Additionally, please advise if there are any concerns based on her lab work that I should monitor.

Thank you for your guidance and for taking great care of Pennie.

Best regards,
Jennifer Thompson

Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for your email. Based on Pennie’s current status and lab results, she is due for her core vaccinations. I recommend scheduling her for a rabies vaccination and a booster for her distemper, parvovirus, and adenovirus immunizations.

Also, I suggest starting her on a routine heartworm preventive treatment and a monthly flea/tick preventative if not already in place. There is nothing concerning in her lab work at this time; the mild increase in white blood cells is most likely due to the stress of the visit.

Please contact our office to arrange an appointment for these preventive treatments.

Best regards,
Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM
