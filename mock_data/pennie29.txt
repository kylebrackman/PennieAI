Follow-Up Neurological Re-Evaluation Report
Examination Date: October 2, 2013
Patient Name: Pennie
Owner: Jennifer Thompson
Attending Veterinarian: Dr. Susan Ramirez, DVM – Neurology Unit
Clinic: Brookside Veterinary Clinic – Neurology Unit

Clinical Summary:
Pennie was re-evaluated to assess changes in her neurological status after initiating the empirical anti-inflammatory treatment. The owner reported occasional worsening of ataxia and sporadic episodes of disorientation over the past two months.

Examination Findings:

Gait & Coordination:
Persistent, mild ataxia remains, with slightly increased stumbling noted on uneven surfaces.
Neurological Function:
A slight delay in proprioceptive responses persists, particularly on the left side.
No overt seizures were observed during the exam, but brief periods of disorientation were noted.
Repeat Imaging Comparison:
A comparison with the previous MRI (Document 27) indicates that the subtle hyperintensities in the white matter appear slightly more pronounced, though still nonspecific.
Assessment & Plan:

The re-evaluation suggests a gradual progression of the neurological abnormalities despite treatment.
Recommendations include a repeat of key laboratory markers (see Document 30), continued empirical treatment, and close monitoring for any further deterioration.
A follow-up appointment is scheduled in three months to reassess clinical status and adjust therapy as necessary.
