Dear Jennifer,

Following our consultation on December 20th regarding Pennie’s allergic dermatitis, I wanted to provide you with the detailed treatment plan and follow-up instructions.

Treatment Plan:

Oral Antihistamine: Administer as directed on the prescription label (dosage based on weight).
Topical Care: Use the prescribed anti-inflammatory shampoo every other day until the skin shows significant improvement.
Environmental Management: Try to minimize Pennie’s exposure to known allergens such as dust and pollen when possible.
Please observe Pennie closely for any changes in her symptoms. If you notice increased irritation, new areas of redness, or if her condition worsens, contact our clinic immediately.

A follow-up appointment is scheduled for January 20, 2012, to review her progress and adjust the treatment plan if necessary.

Thank you for your attention to these details and your continued care for Pennie.

Best regards,
Dr. Susan Ramirez
Brookside Veterinary Clinic
