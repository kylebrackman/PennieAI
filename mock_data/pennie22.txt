Dear Dr. Brooks,

I wanted to update you on Pennie’s progress since our behavioral consultation on April 12th. Following your recommendations, I have been implementing the desensitization exercises and providing her with interactive toys during my absences.

I am pleased to report that there seems to be a noticeable decrease in her anxiety. She remains calmer during short separations and barks less than before. I am continuing the protocol and have adjusted my routine to allow for gradual increases in separation time.

I would appreciate any additional tips or modifications you might suggest at this stage, and I look forward to our scheduled follow-up in six weeks.

Thank you for your help and guidance.

Best regards,
Jennifer Thompson
