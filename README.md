# PennieAI

**AI-Powered Veterinary Document Analysis System**

PennieAI is a production-focused veterinary assistant that streamlines clinical workflows by intelligently analyzing and extracting structured data from unstructured veterinary documents. Using OpenAI's advanced language models, PennieAI can process emails, patient records, lab reports, and clinical notes to automatically extract patient information and segment individual documents from large concatenated files.

## Overview

### The Problem

Veterinarians often receive large files containing multiple documents - patient histories, lab results, referral emails, and clinical notes all concatenated together. Manually parsing these files is time-consuming and error-prone, taking valuable time away from patient care.

### The Solution

PennieAI automates this process by:

1. **Intelligent Document Segmentation**: Uses a sliding window algorithm to identify document boundaries in large files
2. **Patient Information Extraction**: Automatically extracts and structures patient data (name, species, breed, sex, weight, etc.)
3. **Incremental Processing**: Builds on previously extracted data to avoid duplicates and ensure completeness
4. **Structured Storage**: Stores all extracted information in PostgreSQL for easy retrieval and analysis
5. **Rate-Limited AI Integration**: Implements Redis-backed rate limiting to control OpenAI API costs

---

### Sliding Window Algorithm

PennieAI uses a sophisticated sliding window approach to process large documents:

1. **Window Creation**: Document is split into overlapping windows of text
2. **AI Analysis**: Each window is analyzed by OpenAI to identify:
   - Patient information within the window
   - Complete documents (with start/end line numbers)
3. **Incremental Building**: Each subsequent window receives:
   - Previously extracted patient data
   - List of already-identified documents
4. **Deduplication**: New findings are merged with existing data, avoiding duplicates by comparing line numbers

This allows PennieAI to handle documents of unlimited length while maintaining context and avoiding redundant processing.

- **GraphQL**: Alternative to REST
- **gRPC**: For inter-service communication
- **Microservices**: Split into specialized services as needed

---

## Current Progress

### What Works Today

1. **Document Upload & Analysis**: Upload a veterinary document and receive structured patient data and segmented documents
2. **Intelligent Extraction**: AI extracts patient demographics and identifies document boundaries
3. **Rate Limited API**: 100 requests/hour to control OpenAI costs
4. **CRUD Operations**: Full management of analyzed documents
5. **Scalable Architecture**: PostgreSQL + Redis ready for production workloads

### Known Limitations

1. **Synchronous Processing**: Large documents can cause HTTP timeouts (will be fixed in Phase 2 with background jobs)
2. **No Caching**: Every analysis hits OpenAI API (expensive)
3. **No Authentication**: API is open to anyone (security risk)
4. **Manual Deployment**: No CI/CD pipeline yet
5. **Limited Observability**: Basic logging, no metrics or tracing
